# IBM Article Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a recommendation system for IBM's article-sharing platform. Users interact with various articles, and based on these interactions, the system recommends relevant content. The project includes three recommendation techniques:

1. **Rank-Based Recommendations** - Uses article popularity to recommend content.
2. **User-User Collaborative Filtering** - Identifies similar users to suggest articles.
3. **Matrix Factorization with SVD** - Uses latent factors to improve recommendations.

## Files Included
- `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies for running the project.
- `README.txt`: Instructions and project description.

## Installation & Setup
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher). Then, install dependencies from the requirement.txt file:

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
2. Run each cell sequentially to explore the data, build recommendation models, and evaluate the results.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand user-article interactions and data distribution.
- **Rank-Based Recommendations**: Uses most viewed articles to recommend to new users.
- **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar interaction patterns and recommends their articles.
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Extracts latent features for improved recommendations.

## Results & Evaluation
The recommendation system successfully suggests articles based on different approaches. Improvements could include content-based filtering or a hybrid model for better personalization.
